      “Good morning! Here is some info you'll need for today:
Weather Check:

It's currently 15.5°C, with a gentle breeze at 6.8 km/h—feels like the perfect morning to step outside. Maybe grab a light jacket, but nothing too heavy!
Your Commute:

You've got a nice 21-minute walk ahead, starting at 9:00 AM. You'll be there by 9:21 AM. The fresh air will feel great on your way—just the thing to shake off that sleepy feeling!
Prayer Times:

    Fajr was at 5:30 AM, but don't worry, plenty of time to catch the next ones!
    Dhuhr is at 12:55 PM.
    Asr is at 5:07 PM.
    Maghrib is at 6:57 PM.
    And Isha wraps up your day at 8:19 PM.

That's your rundown! Let's make today amazing, one step at a time. Just let me know if you need anything else!"”
